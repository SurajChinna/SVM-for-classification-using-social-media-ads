<h1>SVM for classification of social media ads on SUVs</h1>
<h2>About Project:</h2>
<p>
  The project is about predicting whether the users based on their salary will buy SUV or not after advertising on social media.
  The models are built using SVM and Kernel SVM. With SVM using linear kernel, the decision boundary was linear and hence 
  the accuracy of the model was low. After using kernel SVM with rbf kernel, the accuracy increased to 93%, which is really awesome.
